# Twitter-Analysis-R
An example of code demonstrating how to interact with the Twitter API to collect tweets with designated hashtags and then analyse this data for sentiment and location

In order to utilise this code, you will require:

1. A twitter developer account
2. A google developer account with an activated GeoCoding API key

The code comments will show where to insert your keys in string format. Note that, depending on the power of your system, collecting tweets may take several minutes. 

The individual elements - api interaction, location and sentiment analysis, have been separated into individual files for ease of understanding but for simplicity, you may simply run all three components within the same script. 

Thanks to Dr Alex Betts of DEFRA for his help in providing the base API interaction code. Use all applications in a responsible manner and ensure you stick to the twitter developer code of ethics and terms and conditions at all times.
